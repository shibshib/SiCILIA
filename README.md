# SiCILIA

Abstract:
In order to maintain productivity and alertness,
individuals must be thermally comfortable in the space they
occupy (whether it is a cubicle, a room, a car, etc.). However, it
is often difficult to non-intrusively assess an occupant’s “thermal
comfort” and hence most HVAC engineers adopt fixed temperature
settings to “err on the safe side”. These set temperatures
can be too hot or too cold for individuals wearing different
clothing, and as a result lead to feelings of discomfort as well
as wastage of energy. To address these challenges, we develop
SiCILIA, a platform that extracts physical and personal variables
of an occupant’s thermal environment to infer the amount
of clothing insulation without human intervention. Clothing
insulation is one of the most influential factors in determining
thermal comfort. The proposed inference algorithm builds upon
theories of body heat transfer, and is corroborated by empirical
data. Experimental results show that the algorithm is capable
of accurately predicting an occupant’s thermal insulation with a
mean prediction error of approximately 0.2 clo.

This work is part of a project I worked on early in my PhD career. It has since been closed and I am no longer working on it.
